How to Use:
- A user must sign in with an email that is registered with the game.  If the user has not already registered then the user can sign-up with an email and create a password, then sign-in.
  - Only one user needs to sign in to play locally.
- User must then create a new game
- The user who is assumming player X will go first. Then the user who is assumming player O goes next.
- Users play until someone wins or is a tie.
- When game is over user can choose to play again by clicking "New Game" or can sign-out to stop playing.

List of Technologies Used:
- Atom
- Google Chrome
- Google Chrome Inspector
- MacBook Pro
- GitHub
- GitHub Enterprise Issue Que

Planning:
- Made a wireframe with user stories.
- Then worked on game logic.
- Then worked on authentication API to place sign-in, sign-up, change-password, and sign-out fields.
- Then worked on Game Ui which included much of the user interaction with the game.
- Then worked on the game API to allow the game to communicate with the API to create a game, update a game, and to get games.
- Then did some final touches like styling.

Usolved Problems:
- Didn't have a chance to make an AI so when a user has no one to play with, the user can play with an AI.
- Want to add different tokens so users can have a choice on which they want to use for X or O instead of just the X and O letters.
- Need to make it compatible to mobile devices and interactve with different window sizes!!!  I missed the opportunity to do it at the beginning of the project because I didn't think of it. I feel like I really dropped the ball in this area. This will be my top priority.
- Want to do some more work on the get games API, to get back a variety of statistics.
- Also, want to work more on styling, to make it look better.

Wireframes and User Stories:
- Link to wireframes: https://imgur.com/DQCsjO8
- User stories:
  - As a user I want to have a homepage where I can sign in and/or sign up
  - As a user I want to click on any square in the diagram and mark it with a X or O and do not want my oppnent to be able to click on the same square.
  - As a user I want be able to click a replay button where we can start a new game and I want to be able to reset the scoreboard if there is one.
  - As a user I want to track my wins and loses.
